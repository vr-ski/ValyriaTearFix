*** \brief Represents a party of characters
***
*** This class is a container for a group or "party" of characters. A party is a type
*** of target for items and skills. The GameGlobal class also organizes characters
*** into parties for convienence. Note that an character may be either an enemy or
*** a character, but you should avoid creating parties that contain both characters
*** and enemies, as it can lead to conflicts. For example, a character and enemy which
*** enemy which have the same ID value).
***
*** Parties may or may not allow duplicate characters (a duplicate character is defined
*** as an character that has the same _id member as another character in the party).
*** This property is determined in the GlobalParty constructor
***
*** \note When this class is destroyed, the characters contained within the class are
*** <i>not</i> destroyed. Only the references to those characters through this class object
*** are lost.
***
*** \note All methods which perform an operation by using an character ID are
*** <b>only</b> valid to use if the party does not allow duplicates.
